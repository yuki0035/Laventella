# Laventella

LAVENTELLA: A SMuFL-compliant font for music notation.
Version 1.000

Laventella is a music font designed for typesetting sheet music. The design inspiration for this font comes mainly from Chinese sheet music from the period of 1949 to 1976. During the design process, due to the original fonts' shortcomings in printing and design, Laventella only draws creative inspiration from the original fonts rather than being a direct reproduction.

## Installation
Place the Laventella.json file in one of the following locations:

Windows: C:\Program Files\Common Files\SMuFL\Fonts\Sebastian\Sebastian.json
Mac: /Library/Application Support/SMuFL/Fonts/Sebastian/Sebastian.json

Then install Laventella.otf as any other font files.

## Usage
This font is primarily intended for use with the music notation software Dorico, but it can also be used in other SMuFL-compatible software such as Finale.

## License
Laventella is offered on the SIL Open Font Licence.
